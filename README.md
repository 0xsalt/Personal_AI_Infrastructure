# Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI)

This is a project designed to give anyone in the world a personal AI infrastructure for orchestrating their lives‚Äîincluding both personal and professional.

Based off my own personal Digital Assistant, Kai, it combines a scaffolding framework with a growing set of real-world examples of tools that help things people do in their lives, including:

- Research
- Writing
- Studying
- Health
- Finances
- Family 
- Etc.

The project will start small and grow with time as I add examples.

Also, this system will largely mirror Kai himself, and will be where I provide the files and code for everything I talk about on the [Unsupervised Learning YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@unsupervisedlearning). So when I talk about a new piece of functionality in a video, this is where I'll share the code for it.

NOTE: Kai is based on the [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) ecosystem, but the scaffolding is Text/Markdown based, and designed to be portable to any other platform with little modification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Your First Steps (ONCE I ADD SOME CONTENT, which will be very soon...)

1. **Clone this repository** and explore the example structures
2. **Set up your UFC Context directory** at `~/.claude/context/`
3. **Configure your first Digital Assistant** using the templates
4. **Start with one workflow** (I recommend daily briefings or research)
5. **Iterate and expand** based on your actual needs

Remember: This is YOUR infrastructure. Every configuration, every tool, every workflow should serve your unique life and goals.
