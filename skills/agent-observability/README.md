## Credits & Inspiration

This agent observability system was inspired by **[@indydevdan](https://github.com/indydevdan)**'s pioneering work on multi-agent observability for Claude Code.

**Key Differences in Our Implementation:**

| Feature | indydevdan's Approach | Our Approach |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Data Storage** | SQLite database (persistent) | Filesystem JSONL + In-memory (last 1000 events) |
| **Event Capture** | API calls to database | Direct filesystem writes via hooks |
| **Real-time Updates** | Database polling | File watching with WebSocket streaming |
| **Persistence** | Full historical data | Last 1000 events in memory, JSONL files on disk |
| **Dependencies** | SQLite, API server | Bun filesystem watcher, WebSocket |

**Why We Chose Filesystem Approach:**
- ✅ Tight integration with Claude Code hooks system
- ✅ No external database dependencies
- ✅ Simple JSONL format (human-readable, grep-able)
- ✅ Lightweight - streams only what's needed
- ✅ Works offline - no API calls required

Both approaches have merits! Check out [indydevdan's work](https://github.com/indydevdan) for a database-backed solution with full historical persistence.

## How It Works

Our implementation leverages Claude Code's hook system to capture events directly to the filesystem, then streams them to a real-time web dashboard:

1. **Claude Code Hooks** - Capture all agent events (tool use, session start, errors, etc.)
2. **JSONL Files** - Events written to daily log files in `~/.claude/history/raw-outputs/`
3. **File Watcher** - Bun server watches for new events using filesystem monitoring
4. **In-Memory Buffer** - Last 1000 events kept in memory for fast access
5. **WebSocket Streaming** - Real-time event delivery to connected clients
6. **Vue 3 Dashboard** - Interactive visualization with filtering and swim lanes

**No database required. No API calls. Just filesystem + WebSocket streaming.**

```

**Event Flow:**
1. Claude Code executes hooks on various events (tool use, session start, etc.)
2. `capture-all-events.ts` appends events to daily JSONL file
3. Server watches JSONL files for changes using Bun's filesystem API
4. New events are added to in-memory buffer and streamed via WebSocket
5. Vue frontend displays events in real-time with swim lane visualization

### Event Types Captured

| Event Type | Description | Captured Data |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `session_start` | New agent session begins | Agent ID, timestamp, configuration |

## Troubleshooting

### No events appearing

**Check environment variable:**
```bash
echo $PAI_DIR
# Should output: /Users/yourname/.claude
```

**Verify directory exists:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/history/raw-outputs
```

**Check hook is configured:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep capture-all-events
```

**Make hook executable:**
```bash
chmod +x /Users/yourname/Projects/PAI/skills/agent-observability/hooks/capture-all-events.ts
```

**Check Claude Code output for errors:**
Look for hook execution errors in your terminal when running Claude Code.

---

### Events file not found

**File naming convention:**
```
~/.claude/history/raw-outputs/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_all-events.jsonl
```

**Check if files are being created:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/history/raw-outputs/$(date +%Y-%m)/
```

**Manually test the hook:**
```bash
cd /Users/yourname/Projects/PAI/skills/agent-observability/hooks
PAI_DIR="/Users/yourname/.claude" bun run capture-all-events.ts
```

---

### WebSocket connection failed

**Check server is running:**
```bash
# Should show server on port 3001
lsof -i :3001
```

**Check for port conflicts:**
```bash
# Kill conflicting process
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3001)
```

**Restart both server and client:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd apps/server && bun run dev

# Terminal 2
cd apps/client && bun run dev
```

**Check browser console:**
Open DevTools (F12) and look for WebSocket connection errors.

---

### Permission denied

**Make hook executable:**
```bash
chmod +x skills/agent-observability/hooks/capture-all-events.ts
```

**Check directory permissions:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/history/
# Should be writable by your user
```

**Verify PAI_DIR write access:**
```bash
touch ~/.claude/test-write && rm ~/.claude/test-write
# Should succeed without errors
```

---

### Events not updating in real-time

**Check file watcher is working:**
```bash
# Server logs should show "Watching for file changes..."
```

**Test manual event creation:**
```bash
echo '{"timestamp":"2025-01-28T12:00:00Z","type":"test","data":{}}' >> \
  ~/.claude/history/raw-outputs/$(date +%Y-%m)/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_all-events.jsonl
```

**Restart the server:**
File watchers can sometimes get stuck. Restart the server to reset.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with standard Claude Code installations?**
A: Yes! It works with any Claude Code installation that supports hooks. Just configure the hook in your `settings.json`.

**Q: How much disk space do JSONL files use?**
A: Typical usage is 1-10 MB per day. Files are organized by month for easy cleanup.

**Q: Can I analyze historical data?**
A: Yes! JSONL files are human-readable. Use standard tools like `jq`, `grep`, or custom scripts.

**Q: Why not use indydevdan's approach?**
A: Both approaches are valid! Our filesystem approach integrates tightly with PAI's existing infrastructure. Use indydevdan's if you need full database persistence.

**Q: Can I run multiple dashboards?**
A: Yes! The server supports multiple WebSocket clients. Open multiple browser tabs if needed.

**Q: Does this slow down Claude Code?**
A: No. Hook execution is asynchronous and writes are buffered. Impact is negligible.
